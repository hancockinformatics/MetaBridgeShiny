## **Description**

MetaBridge is a [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)-based application for 
integration of metabolomics data with other omics types, chiefly
transcriptomics and proteomics.

## **Publications**

* MetaBridge: An Integrative Multi‐Omics Tool for Metabolite‐Enzyme Mapping. *Current Protocols in Bioinformatics.* doi: [10.1002/cpbi.98](https://doi.org/10.1002/cpbi.98)

* MetaBridge: enabling network-based integrative analysis via direct protein interactors of metabolites. *Bioinformatics.* doi: [10.1093.bioinformatics/bty331](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty331)

## **Usage**

MetaBridge is designed to facilitate integrative analysis by identifying the
enzymes that directly interact with metabolites of interest, yielding genes
which may then be integrated with results from other omics methods. A pipeline
may be designed as such:
