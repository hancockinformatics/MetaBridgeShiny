Description: MetaBridge is a Shiny-based application for integration of 
    metabolomics data with other omics data types, chiefly transcriptomics and 
    proteomics. It leverages publicly available data from both MetaCyc and KEGG 
    to map input metabolites to genes, through pathways and reactions in which 
    the metabolite is involved.
